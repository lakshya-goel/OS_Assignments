Description of the program logic:

First a new syscall entry is added to : syscall_64.tbl
# 451 kernel_2D_memcpy sys_kernel_2D_memcpy

then, the required syscall to copy a 2D matrix is implemented in: sys.c
The code of implemented syscall is attached.

After that, a fresh kernel is compiled to reflect the new set of syscalls.
code used:
# make
# make modules
# make modules_install
# make bzImage
# cp -v arch/x86/boot/bzImage /boot/vmlinuz-linuxAB
# cp /etc/mkinitcpio.d/linux.preset /etc/mkinitcpio.d/linuxAB.preset
# nano /etc/mkinitcpio.d/linuxAB.preset
# # mkinitcpio -p linuxAB

The syscall is tested via a test file: test.c
The code of the tester file is also attached.
